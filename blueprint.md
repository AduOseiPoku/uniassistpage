# UniAssist Landing Page Blueprint

## Overview

A static, purely informative landing page for 'UniAssist,' an educational platform for prospective university students. The page will have a clean, professional, and academic aesthetic with a primary color palette of navy blue and white. It will be a single-page scrolling layout with no active 'Call to Action' buttons or interactive sign-up forms, focusing on a high-end editorial design.

    *   Add the content for each section as specified.
    *   Link to `style.css` and `main.js`.
2.  **Create `style.css`:**
    *   Implement the color palette (navy blue and white).
    *   Set up the typography using Google Fonts.
    *   Style the sections with a focus on clean spacing and readability.
    *   Add responsive styles using media queries.
3.  **Create `main.js`:**
    *   The file will be created but will be empty for now as no interactivity is required.
